An internationalization library, targeted at Fulcro 3 applications.

See https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-i18n/blob/master/I18N.adoc[documentation] for usage.

NOTE: Breaking change from 0.0.4-alpha -> 0.0.5-alpha. LocaleSelector was moved to
a new ns so that i18n could be used from React Native. You will need to update your requires.
